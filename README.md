## **Overview**
Car Price Predictor allows users to estimate vehicle prices using a machine learning model trained on web data, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.
It is a simple end-to-end data science project consisting of:
- **Data Collection**: Scraping data from autoscout24.com using Scrapy
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleaning the scraped data to remove missing values and outliers
- **Data Exploration**: Exploring the cleaned data using statistics and visualizations
- **Model Building**: Comparing different regression models to predict car prices and selecting the best one, then tuning the hyperparameters
- **Model Deployment**: Deploying the model using FastAPI
- **User Interface**: Creating a simple user interface using Dash to interact with the deployed model and access autoscoot24.com without having to re-enter the car details
