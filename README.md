# Car Price Predictor
This project uses car offers scraped from AutoScoot24 to predict the price of a vehicle based on its features (brand, model, mileage, etc). The user can simply enter the features in the UI which will give him an estimation of the price of the vehicle he is interested in. The UI offers a functionality where the user can be redirected to AutoScoot24 website without needing to re-enter the vehicle specifications.
